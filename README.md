# Embed Code File (Obsidian Plugin)

This plugin allows to embed code files from Obsidian vault or remote file (eg., GitHub). It works better with live preview feature of Obsidian.

## Settings

The plugin include multiple language by default (`c,cpp,java,python,go,ruby,javascript,js,typescript,ts,shell,sh,bash`). You can include any needed language to the comma separated list.

## How to use

First you need to activate the plugin from Community Plugins. Then you can embed the code as follow:

````yaml
```embed-<some-language>
PATH: "vault://<some-path-to-code-file>" or "http[s]://<some-path-to-remote-file>"
LINES: "<some-line-number>,<other-number>,...,<some-range>"
TITLE: "<some-title>"
```
````

Examples:

#### Vault File:

````yaml
```embed-cpp
PATH: "vault://Code/main.cpp"
LINES: "2,9,30-40,100-122,150"
TITLE: "Some title"
```
````

#### Remote File:

````yaml
```embed-cpp
PATH: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/almariah/embed-code-file/main/main.ts"
LINES: "30-40"
TITLE: "Some title"
```
````

where `PATH`, `LINES` and `TITLE` properties are set as YAML key-value pairs:

* The `PATH` should be a code file in the vault or remote. If you have used GitHub for example, make sure to use `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...`

* The `LINES` will include only the specified lines of the code file. Every set of included lines either range or explicit line will append dots (`...`) to included line in a newline. If you want to get rid of dots, minimize the number of sets by using one range as much as you can.


* The `TAGS` will include only the lines between the tags, which may be comments. It does not include the tagges lines.  

````yaml
```embed-js
PATH: "vault://H-ToHTML/js/test.js"
TAGS: "// array02"
TITLE: "Javascript Arrays"
```
````

Example:
```js
// array02
{
    const array = []; // const: Veränderung des Array OK, neue Zuweisung nicht!
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        array.push(i);  // Ans Ende anfügen
    }
    console.log(array); // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
}
// array02
```



* If `TITLE` is not set, then the title of the code block will be `PATH` value.

You can use also `TITLE` with normal code block (without `embed-`), but make sure that the title value is set with double quotes:

````cpp
```cpp TITLE: "Some title"
// some code
...
```
````

Using live preview feature will enhance the embedding experience.
